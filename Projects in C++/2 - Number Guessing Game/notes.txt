Let's go step by step through the **Number Guessing Game** implementation in C++.

---

## **1. Include Necessary Headers**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
```
- `#include <iostream>` → For input/output operations (`std::cin`, `std::cout`).
- `#include <cstdlib>` → For using `std::rand()` (random number generation).
- `#include <ctime>` → To seed the random number generator with the current time.

---

## **2. Function to Play the Game**
```cpp
void playGame(int maxTries, int range) {
    std::srand(std::time(0));  // Seed for random number generation
    int secretNumber = std::rand() % range + 1;  // Generate a number between 1 and `range`
    int guess, attempts = 0;
```
- `std::srand(std::time(0));` → Seeds the random number generator to ensure different outputs each time the game is played.
- `std::rand() % range + 1;` → Generates a random number between **1 and `range`**.
- `int guess, attempts = 0;` → Initializes variables to store the user’s guess and the number of attempts.

---

## **3. Start the Game Loop**
```cpp
    std::cout << "Guess the number between 1 and " << range << "!\n";

    while (attempts < maxTries) {
        std::cout << "Attempt " << attempts + 1 << "/" << maxTries << ": Enter your guess: ";
        std::cin >> guess;
        attempts++;
```
- Displays the **range** of numbers.
- Runs a `while` loop, allowing the user **up to `maxTries` attempts**.
- Asks the user for input and stores it in `guess`.
- Increments `attempts` after each guess.

---

## **4. Check If the Guess Is Correct**
```cpp
        if (guess == secretNumber) {
            std::cout << "Congratulations! You guessed the number in " << attempts << " attempts.\n";
            return;
        } else if (guess < secretNumber) {
            std::cout << "Too low! Try again.\n";
        } else {
            std::cout << "Too high! Try again.\n";
        }
    }
```
- **If the guess is correct**, the game congratulates the player and exits (`return`).
- **If the guess is too low**, it tells the user to guess a higher number.
- **If the guess is too high**, it tells the user to guess a lower number.
- The loop continues until the user either **guesses correctly** or **exhausts all attempts**.

---

## **5. Display Game Over Message**
```cpp
    std::cout << "Game over! The correct number was " << secretNumber << ".\n";
}
```
- If the loop finishes without a correct guess, the game prints the correct number.

---

## **6. Main Function to Handle Multiple Rounds**
```cpp
int main() {
    int maxTries = 5, range = 100;
    char playAgain;
```
- `maxTries = 5;` → Maximum attempts allowed.
- `range = 100;` → The random number will be between **1 and 100**.
- `char playAgain;` → Used to check if the player wants to play again.

---

## **7. Game Replay Logic**
```cpp
    do {
        playGame(maxTries, range);
        std::cout << "Do you want to play again? (y/n): ";
        std::cin >> playAgain;
    } while (playAgain == 'y' || playAgain == 'Y');
```
- Runs the `playGame()` function.
- Asks the user if they want to play again.
- If the user enters `'y'` or `'Y'`, the game restarts.

---

## **8. End the Game**
```cpp
    std::cout << "Thanks for playing!\n";
    return 0;
}
```
- If the user chooses not to play again, the game thanks them and exits.

---

### **Summary of How the Game Works**
1. The game **generates a random number** between `1` and `100`.
2. The user has **5 chances** to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the game provides **hints** (Too High/Too Low).
4. If the user **guesses correctly**, they win.
5. If they fail to guess within the allowed attempts, the game **reveals the correct number**.
6. The game **asks if they want to play again**.
