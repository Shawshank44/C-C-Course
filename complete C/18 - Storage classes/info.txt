In the C programming language, storage classes determine the scope, lifetime, and linkage of variables and functions. 
They dictate how and where variables are stored in memory, how long they persist, 
and how they can be accessed across different parts of a program. 
Understanding storage classes is crucial for writing efficient, maintainable, and error-free C code.

C provides several storage classes:
# auto
# register
# static
# extern
# thread_local (introduced in C11)


1. auto
Overview 
Definition: The auto storage class is the default for all local variables inside functions. 
It signifies that the variable has automatic storage duration.
Scope: Block scope (the variable is accessible only within the block or function where it's defined).
Lifetime: The variable exists only during the execution of the block in which it is defined.
Linkage: No linkage (the variable is not accessible outside its scope).
Initialization: Not automatically initialized; contains an indeterminate value if not explicitly initialized.

2. extern
Overview
Definition: Declares a global variable or function that is defined in another file.
Scope: Depends on where it's declared; generally, it's used at the file scope.
Lifetime: The entire runtime of the program.
Linkage: External linkage (accessible across multiple translation units).
Initialization: Not initialized; assumes the variable or function is defined elsewhere.


3. static
The static storage class serves multiple purposes depending on where it's applied.
A. Static Local Variables
Overview
Definition: Retains the variable's value between function calls.
Scope: Block scope.
Lifetime: The entire runtime of the program.
Linkage: No linkage.
Initialization: Automatically initialized to zero if not explicitly initialized.

B. Static Global Variables and Functions
Overview
Definition: Limits the scope of a global variable or function to the file in which it's declared.
Scope: File scope.
Lifetime: The entire runtime of the program.
Linkage: Internal linkage (not accessible from other translation units).

4. register
Overview
Definition: Suggests that the variable be stored in a CPU register for faster access.
Scope: Block scope.
Lifetime: Same as autoâ€”exists only during the execution of the block.
Linkage: No linkage.
Initialization: Not automatically initialized.
